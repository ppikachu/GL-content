#keratina
Hair is kept together through a highly innovative method, created and refined by Great Lengths. This procedure is based on the use of Great Lengths keratin; a copolymeric compound whose molecular structure resembles very closely the structure and behaviour of human hair: expanding when exposed to water, and contracting upon drying.

#remy
The term «Remy» defines hair that, within the same strand, is all in the same direction from the roots to the ends.

«Remy» hair is synonymous with high quality and appears healthier, smoother, and shinier; this means that the alignment of the cuticles avoids unpleasant tangling.
Our procurement process ensures that all our hair is Remy. We maintain meticulous quality control, guaranteeing the natural direction of the hair across all stages of production. Furthermore, meticulous quality control guarantees that the natural direction of the hair is maintained across all stages of a production.

#double
We use the term "single drawn" when referring to hair coming straight from India, from a single donor, in bundles composed of hair of varying length.

Before it enters the production cycle, Great Lengths hair must become Double Drawn, which means that it has to be divided and matched according to the different lengths.
